## Design Consideration ##
- It is very client centric that means legacy component is integrated with client using Adapter.
- Often time integrated with interface but not always the same case

Example
Interger[] arrayofInt=new Integer[]{1,2,3};
List<Integer> listOfInt=Array.asList(arrayofInt);

Note: array is adapted into List. Thus, it is adapter design pattern.
